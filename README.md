# Scientific data visualization project Group 1

# Introduction
This project aims to address the complexities of financial management in private schools by leveraging advanced data visualization techniques. The project focuses on the creation of an interactive platform that visualizes various aspects of tuition dynamics, including but not limited to billing information, discount structures, and overall financial health indicators. This initiative is set to employ a variety of tools, with a mandatory inclusion of D3.js for creating interactive and custom visualizations, supplemented by other visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, seaborn, matplotlib, and Altair. These tools will be instrumental in analyzing the dataset, generating insights, and fostering informed decision-making processes
